#### DeepLNDataset description
This dataset is collected to construct a model that can be used to detect lung nodules from multi-resolution CT images. A three-level labeling criterion and a semi-automatic annotation system are presented to guarantee the correctness and efficiency of lung nodule annotation. The details of annotation process are introduced in our article. This dataset include two kinds of resolution CT: thin-section CT images with 1mm thickness and thick-section CT images with 5mm thickness.


#### Dataset available
To remove sensitive infomation, we just remain HU values and spacing of CT images
and save them in a *numpy*. If some researchers want to obtain this dataset please
contact us and send us a e-mail.
